  2019-06-07 : UDP broadcast transport in flat IP / Ethernet
 ............: subnets such as WiFi will be useful for IoT
 ~ Must be ~ : devices without using a dedicated IRC server.

  2020-01-08 : Consider the possibility of seralization using
 ............: the Protocol Buffers for direct communication
  ~ Useful ~ : through UDP and when using encryption, in order
 ............: to reduce the size of transmitted messages.

  2020-01-11 : In "SERVER" mode of the class PyLayerIRC, it is
 ............: need to implement three variants of port binding:
 ~ Must be ~ : 1. only on IPv4 address, 2. only on IPv6 address,
 ............: 3. on both addresses (Dual Stack)

  2020-01-17 : In the case when one of the modes of automatic
 ............: loading of dynamic modules is selected, provide
 ~ Must be ~ : for their automatic unloading by timeout.

  2020-02-05 : It is need to debug the BASE85 base coding in
 ............: combination with RSA cryptographic encryption.
 ~ Urgent! ~ : BASE85 coding can be set by default, instead
 ............: of BESE64, since it saves 6%, it is still 7-bit
 ~ Must be ~ : and allows it to be placed in the JSON string.

  2020-02-08 : There is some warnings in the 'twofish' module:
 ............: PendingDeprecationWarning: import 'imp' module;
  Figure out : ResourceWarning: unclosed file 'BufferedReader'

  2020-03-12 : It would be useful to implement another transport
 ............: level of the IRC-IoT protocol based on the Modbus-
  ~ Useful ~ : TCP which would allow interconnect infrastructures

  2020-03-22 : The JSON module included in the installation of
 ............: the Python language does not support the "bytes"
 ~ Problem ~ : data type. It may be need to use another module.

  2020-03-23 : It would be useful to implement another transport
 ............: type of the IRC-IoT protocol based on the HTTP/x
  ~ Useful ~ : protocols as it is done for the SOAP or XML-RPC.

  2020-03-25 : The protocol JMAP (JSON Meta Application protocol)
 ............: can be encapsulated into the IRC-IoT transport, so
  ~ Useful ~ : its API may be submitted to the Global Dictionary.

  2020-05-01 : For protection services from flood, both directly
 ............: and through the IRC-IoT routers, using an assigned
  ~ Useful ~ : task can be used, for example, how it is done in
 ............: the HashCache. Also, Embedded Languages may used.
