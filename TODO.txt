  2020-01-08 : Consider the possibility of seralization using
 ............: the Protocol Buffers for direct communication
  ~ Useful ~ : through UDP and when using encryption, in order
 ............: to reduce the size of transmitted messages.

  2020-01-11 : In "SERVER" mode of the class PyLayerIRC, it is
 ............: need to implement three variants of port binding:
 ~ Must be ~ : 1. only on IPv4 address, 2. only on IPv6 address,
 ............: 3. on both addresses (Dual Stack)

  2020-01-17 : In the case when one of the modes of automatic
 ............: loading of dynamic modules is selected, provide
 ~ Must be ~ : for their automatic unloading by timeout.

  2020-02-08 : There is some warnings in the 'twofish' module:
 ............: PendingDeprecationWarning: import 'imp' module;
  Figure out : ResourceWarning: unclosed file 'BufferedReader'

  2020-03-12 : It would be useful to implement another transport
 ............: level of the IRC-IoT protocol based on the Modbus-
  ~ Useful ~ : TCP which would allow interconnect infrastructures

  2020-03-22 : The JSON module included in the installation of
 ............: the Python language does not support the "bytes"
 ~ Problem ~ : data type. It may be need to use another module.

  2020-03-23 : It would be useful to implement another transport
 ............: type of the IRC-IoT protocol based on the HTTP/x
  ~ Useful ~ : protocols as it is done for the SOAP or XML-RPC.

  2020-03-25 : The protocol JMAP (JSON Meta Application protocol)
 ............: can be encapsulated into the IRC-IoT transport, so
  ~ Useful ~ : its API may be submitted to the Global Dictionary.

  2020-05-01 : For protection services from flood, both directly
 ............: and through the IRC-IoT routers, using an assigned
  ~ Useful ~ : task can be used, for example, how it is done in
 ............: the HashCache. Also, Embedded Languages may used.

  2020-05-08 : The PyBasic package is being developed on the net
 ............: under GNU GPL license, it is the BASIC interpreter
  ~ Useful ~ : written in the Python language, it will be useful
 ............: to connect it to the PyLayerIRCIoT_EL_ class.

  2020-05-14 : Since encryption algorithms with a Secret Key are
 ............: faster than Symmetric algorithms, it is necessary
 ~ Must be ~ : to implement a two-stage encryption mechanism,
 ............: for example: RSA + AES and RSA + Twofish, etc.

  2020-05-16 : When IRC-IoT nodes exchanging messages thru IRC
 ............: with a maximum fixed MTU, problems with trimming
 ~ Urgent! ~ : the tails of messages appears, this depends on
 ............: the length of the Nickname, the hostname and on
 the server settings. The MTU negotiation algorithm is required.
 To workaround problem, the default MTU is reduced to 440 bytes.

  2020-06-12 : It would be useful to add to the PyIRCIoT library
 ............: support for the "MAGMA" encryption algorithm in
  ~ Useful ~ : accordance with the Russian standard GOST 28147-89

  2020-07-01 : It will be useful to implement PEP 257 "Doctring
 ............: Conventions" recomendations from official Python
  ~ Useful ~ : Developer's Guide for PyIRCIoT demo library code.

  2020-07-09 : It is need to create a set of functions to start
 ............: working in the Docker environment when using the
 ~ Must be ~ : PyLayerIRCIoT_EL_ class.

  2020-08-19 : It would be useful to create or use an existing
 ............: library to implement the IRC client and IRC-IoT
  ~ Useful ~ : protocol stack on Arduino and Atmel controllers

  2020-10-02 : It would be nice to create an data collecting
 ............: module for the Telegraf and Dashboard for the
  ~ Useful ~ : Grafana systems, displaying data from IRC-IoT

  2020-12-27 : It would be great to provide in IRC-IoT endpoint
 ............: robots implementing interaction over different IoT
  ~ Useful ~ : protocols, such as MQTT, CoAP, KNX, Z-Wave, etc.
 ............: a kind of "anti-virus" that checks the connected
 IoT devices for vulnerabilities to known exploits, so that int-
 ruders through such devices can not affect the IRC-IoT network.

  2021-02-25 : It's reasonable to implement zigbee2irciot gateway
 ............: by analogy with zigbee2mqtt gateway for similar
  ~ Useful ~ : radio module firmwares without using MQTT protocol
 ............: It would also be useful to implement this function
 for the ESP8266/ESP32 modules, as it is done in the SLS project.

  2021-04-22 : It is necessary to debug the PyIRCIoT library to
 ............: work under Ubuntu Touch (UBports) system and
 ~ Must be ~ : Termux sandbox under Android OS

  2021-10-31 : It is necessary to consider the possibility of
 ............: integration with the following platforms, make
 ~ Must be ~ : appropriate Global Dictionary sections for:
 Apache Pulsar, AWS IoT, AWS Kinesis, AWS SOS, Azure Event HUB,
 Azure IoT HUB, IBM Watson IoT, Kafka, OPC Unified Architecture

  2025-03-31 : It is necessary to make integration with the
 ............: Matter protocol, for example in the form of
 ~ Must be ~ : the microservice gateway, IRC-IoT client
