# PyIRCIoT

IRC-IoT is the universal protocol for building Internet of things (IoT)

More info about IRC-IoT protocol you can find at [irc-iot.org](http://irc-iot.org/?lang=en)

`PyIRCIoT` is a demonstration library implementing the core functions
of the IRC-IoT protocol

Since there is no `PyGOST` working library on the PyPI service starting
from 2023, you can download it from the IRC-IoT project Web-site:
 [https://irc-iot.org/archive/](https://irc-iot.org/archive/)
and install it manually:
 pip3 install pygost-5.*.tar.gz
