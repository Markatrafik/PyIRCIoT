	* An additional field VUID (Virtual User ID) has been added to the
	interaction Queues with PyLayerIRC. Please note that you need to make
	changes to your IRC-IoT robots.

2019-03-08 09:03 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.79 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
	* Since version 0.0.79 for all PyLayerIRCIoT methods with the name
	beginning with irciot_deinencap*_ a new optional argument is added:
	in_vuid (Virtual User ID). Also, added maintenance of a database of
	Virtual Users at the level of the IRC protocol. The database is
	consist	of two parts: Preconfigured users, and previously unknown
	users appeared on IRC. To work with unknown users, you must set the
	key irc_talk_with_stranges to True. The processing of service IRC-IoT
	messages with the object type "bchnfo" (Blockchain Informational msg.)
	and the addition of cryptographic keys from this message to the Virtual
	Users database has been added.

2019-04-26 19:30 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.107 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * Since Version 0.0.107 in all methods of PyLayerIRCIoT new optional
        parameter has been added: in_vuid (Virtual User ID), by default: None
        In API beetwen PyLayerIRCIoT and any transport class new method added:
        with index api_GET_VUID = 700, and optional parameters 'in_vuid':
        'c': get configured VUIDs, 't': get temporal VUIDs, '*': get all VUIDs
        Also, the new transport class PyLayerCOM added in the file rfc2217.py

2019-04-27 12:30 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.108 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * Since Version 0.0.108; Previously PyLayerIRCIoT.irciot_encap_all_()
        method returned an array (list) of strings, now it returns array of
        touples containing string and VUID. Similar changes were made to the
        parameters of PyLayerIRC.irc_handler_(). Please make the corrections.

2019-05-01 15:00 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.112 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * In API beetwen PyLayerIRCIoT and transport classes new methods has
        been added: api_GET_OMID = 111, and api_SET_OMID = 112, argument: VUID
        Methods api_GET_LMID, api_GET_OMID now returns the set, not a single
        Message ID. In the PyLayerIRC class, a pipeline of Message IDs created
        separately own, and taken from other robots. The size of the pipeline
        is set by the constant: PyLayerIRC.CONST.irc_default_mid_pipeline_size

2019-05-12 12:05 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.117 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * The protocol version was changed to 0.3.27. The "item_name" field
        was added to the structure of the Local Dictionary items, which may
        contain the name of a variable in the structure, it may be useful to
        generate JSON, or SQL queries.

2019-05-17 09:30 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.119 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * The protocol version was changed to 0.3.28. Changes in the structure
        of the Local Dictionary: field name was changed to "precision" and a
        new numeric field "exponent" was added meaning the size of the number,
        which is the degree of base 10, expressed in bits.

2019-06-01 21:45 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.123 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * Added a first simplified version of library worked on MicroPython
        for uploading it to IoT devices such as ESP8266 by Espressif Systems.

2019-08-15 09:05 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.133 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * Changes have been made to the PyLayerIRC class: if the NickName of
        the robot is occupied, it tryies to return its NickName, periodically
        and when another user release the Nick. Warning! Instead of assigning
        a NickName to a variable irc_nick, use method irc_define_nick_(string)

2019-08-25 21:00 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.135 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * The protocol version was changed to 0.3.29. Introduced versioning of
        the IRC-IoT protocol, the interaction for determining the used version
        on the remote side is defined.

2019-09-07 22:45 GMT+7 PyIRCIoT 0.0.137 Alexey Y. Woronov <alexey@woronov.ru>
        * User options has been added for preconfigured users. First option is
        PyLayerIRC.CONST.irc_aop to automatically assign IRC channel operator.
        PyLayerIRCIoT.irciot_deinencap_() method now always returns values
        enclosed in square brackets. Value "[]" this means no values.
